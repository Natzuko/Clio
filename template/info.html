            </h1>
            <h2>art, science, and code
            </h2>

        <div>
            <p>CLIO is the first electronic art gallery specializing in integrating home and building automation,
                focusing on interactive works. It aims to offer unique and immersive experiences and integrate art,
                technology, and intelligent design.
                <br>
                <br>
                Two types of works are offered: automatization works and interactive works. Home automation works can be
                connected to home automation applications via internal network or Wi-Fi, allowing complete integration
                with the rest of the automation systems. The interactive works are autonomous and operate independently
                with a simple on/off switch.
                <br>
                <br>
                In Argentina, there are currently four companies dedicated to home automation and building automation,
                in Forbes Argentina magazine they project an expansion of 41%. There are various applications to connect
                subsystems in the home today.
                <br>
                <br>
                Clio's mission is to promote creativity and technological advancement.
                The marketing circuit must ensure the correct installation of the work and its maintenance. Provide a
                1-year performance warranty (tentative period). And offer a periodic maintenance system. Which may or
                may not be included in the price of the work. Another distinctive sign of Cl√≠o is that we will work with
                commissioned works.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="pregunta">What home and building automation technology will be used in Clio and how will it
                    be integrated into the artworks? </span>
                <br>
                <br>
                We will use hybrid automation systems such as KNX, Z-Wave, and Zigbee that integrate perfectly with
                other lighting, multimedia, etc. controls. Which will allow us to interact with the motion, temperature,
                and sound sensors, and thus generate interactive responses. They are hybrid systems (wired/wi-fi)
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="pregunta">How do we ensure interoperability between different home automation devices and
                    platforms?</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                We will use integration platforms such as Home Assistant or OpenHAB that allow communication between
                devices from different manufacturers and protocols. This will ensure a seamless and cohesive experience
                across all facilities.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="pregunta">
                    What is the financing plan for Clio?
                </span>
                <br>
                <br>
                For Clio, two business models were considered with and without financing.
                <br>
                <br>
                The first business model, without financing, is based on a collaborative system between artists,
                installation and assembly technicians. The initial expenses will be met from the commissioning and/or
                sale of the works. This slow growth model is developed from the addition of partners, mentoring for SMEs
                focused on technological innovation, subsidies, and sponsorships from technology companies.
                <br>
                <br>
                The second business model, with initial financing, projects gradual growth in revenue as we increase our
                visibility and expand. How do you plan to manage operating costs? The idea is to keep operating costs
                low and hire essential personnel for each stage of the gallery's development.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="pregunta">What would the gallery-artist relationship be like?</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                The artists who make up the gallery must provide the technical sheet of the work and the code. It is
                necessary to create a database. The use of Collective Access is suggested, it is an open-source
                platform, developed specifically for the management of art collections of galleries, museums, etc.
                It is necessary to make a representation contract with the artists involved. The technical documentation
                of each work is an essential requirement. The aforementioned contract will establish commissions, image
                rights, and rights to disseminate the work. Periods of validity of the contract, value of the work, etc.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="pregunta">
                    What types of technologies are currently used in electronic arts?
                </span>
                <br>
                <br>
                The development of the works in their entirety is carried out with open-source systems, in sound and
                visual arts. They are systems that dialogue with each other and have low software requirements. Even
                works of generative art. In small and medium-scale works, production costs are relatively low. This
                group belongs to those that have motion sensors, temperature, infrared and ultraviolet sensors, magnets,
                etc. Large-scale works, or mega-installations of course have a higher cost for obvious reasons, wiring,
                etc. These types of installations may be part of the gallery in the next stage of development and
                expansion.
                <br>
                <br>
                The sensors and different devices in Argentina are low-cost. There is an artistic field in which this
                type of work is currently being carried out, it is just that they are not nucleated and the majority
                apply to scholarships or artistic residencies.
                <br>
                <br>
                Clio aspires to become an international benchmark in the field of electronic arts, due to its innovative
                approach. We want to inspire artists, engineers, and the general public to explore new ways of
                interacting with the environment through advanced technologies.
                <br>
                <br>
                Clio proposes working in collaborative environments and creating a community between artists, designers,
                engineers, and universities, through events, streamings, and educational workshops, to promote knowledge
                and the development of skills in creative spaces.
                <br>
                <br>
                When Clio is already positioned in the market, it will be able to develop the following areas:
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="pregunta">Exhibition Rooms:</span> Areas specifically designed to display works of art that
                interact with the environment

                <span class="pregunta">Interactive Spaces:</span> Areas where visitors can experience first-hand the
                integration of art and technology
                in a controlled and intelligent environment.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="pregunta">Conclusion:</span> Clio is not just a gallery, it is a platform for innovation
                and creative development in
                permanent dialogue with art and technology to redefine the perceptible limits of the spaces we inhabit.
                <br>
                <br>
                Clio is much more than a financial and artistic venture, in personal terms, it is a platform for
                artistic projection for new generations, a structure of support and economic solvency for new future
                artists, today in full development.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="pregunta">Degree of progress:</span>
                <br>
                I immediately contacted a home automation technician, who currently works in one of the 4 companies. He
                was interested in the proposal. It was an informal meeting.
                <br>
                <br>
                I contacted a well-known accountant, she is interested in the proposal and is available to provide
                advice on tax issues.
                <br>
                <br>
                I contacted a couple of artists, all interested in the proposal.
                <br>
                <br>
                The steps that follow are: register the gallery name. Create a commercial company, with legal figures
                that minimize the tax burden for developing the aforementioned activity.
                <br>
                <br>
                Write representation contracts
                <br>
                <br>
                Create the database (free software) with the technical documentation of the works and artists.
